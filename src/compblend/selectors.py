"""Token selectors for CompBlend.

What's here (Stage 1, minimum viable):
    - `select_topk_sorted`     — pick top-k by score, return sorted-by-position
    - `gated_top_k`            — paper §3's Gated HKVD selector
    - `chunk_internal_rank`    — opt-in per-chunk normalization helper

What's NOT here (deferred to a later milestone):
    - additive_rank / rank_product / pareto_layered / per_chunk_gated_top_k
      — research alternatives from CompBlend-old. Bring them back only if a
      study needs them. The paper's defended algorithm is gated_top_k.

Fix vs CompBlend-old's gated_top_k
──────────────────────────────────
Old: the engine boosted hkvd[forced]=+inf and imp[forced]=+inf BEFORE
calling gated_top_k. When `forced_count > gate_percentile * N`, all +inf
positions saturated the importance gate, threshold became +inf, no
non-forced positions survived; then top-k by HKVD padded with -inf
positions (random non-eligibles). Documented in our CompBlend-old analysis.

New: `forced_mask` is a first-class parameter. Forced positions are
unconditionally included BEFORE the gate runs (they don't participate in
the gate's percentile computation). The remaining budget is filled by
gating + HKVD over the non-forced, non-structural candidates. No +inf hack
on score tensors; gate cardinality stays interpretable.

    Algorithm:
      1. Include all `forced_mask` positions unconditionally.
      2. Exclude all `structural_mask` positions.
      3. Restrict the candidate pool to `eligible_mask` (None = all).
      4. From the remaining positions, keep those with importance in the top
         `gate_percentile` fraction. With `gate_percentile=0.5`, keeps
         the top 50% by importance.
      5. From the gated set, pick `recompute_k - forced_count` by HKVD.

    Why `eligible_mask` (added 2026-05-27): compression's design intent is
    "evict the unimportant tokens; trust the choice". Recomputation must
    NOT recover evicted tokens — they were deliberately discarded. Pass
    `eligible_mask = (any-head retained at this position)` to restrict the
    selector to the kept set. forced_mask (e.g. last_pos for decode)
    overrides eligibility — those positions are included regardless.

    Args:
        hkvd_scores:        [N] per-token deviation.
        importance_scores:  [N] per-token compression importance.
        recompute_k:        target number of tokens to select.
        gate_percentile:    fraction of non-forced tokens to keep as gated
                            candidates. 1.0 = skip gate. Typical: 0.5.
        structural_mask:    optional [N] bool. True = exempt (never selected).
        forced_mask:        optional [N] bool. True = always selected.
        eligible_mask:      optional [N] bool. True = position is in the
                            candidate pool. None = all positions eligible
                            (backward compat). Under token-prune compression
                            this is all-True (whole tokens are kept/dropped).

    Returns:
        int64 tensor of selected positions, sorted ascending.
